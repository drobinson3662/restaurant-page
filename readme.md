# Ali Baba - A Fictitious Website

This project is part of **The Odin Project** and serves as a hands-on exercise to build a website using DOM manipulation in JavaScript. The website itself, called Ali Baba, is entirely fictitious and demonstrates basic web development techniques, focusing on rendering dynamic content and interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Features and Goals

**DOM Manipulation**: The core of this project involves using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, adding and removing elements, and dynamically updating content based on user interaction.

**JavaScript Modules**: The project is structured across multiple JavaScript files that are bundled using Webpack for better organization and modularity.

**Responsive Design**: The website features basic responsive design principles to ensure a good user experience on different devices.

**UI Interactivity**: User actions (like clicking buttons) trigger content changes, demonstrating how JavaScript can control the structure and presentation of a webpage.

## Technologies Used
**HTML5**: For the basic structure and content of the website.
**CSS3**: For styling, layout, and ensuring the website is visually appealing.
**JavaScript**: For DOM manipulation and interactivity, with separate files for modular code.
**Webpack**: A module bundler to compile and combine JavaScript files and assets.
